//Generics in Java are used to create classes, interfaces, and methods that can operate on any data type while 
//	providing type safety at compile time. The main advantages of using generics are:
//
//Type Safety: Generics allow you to catch type-related errors at compile time rather than at runtime. 
//For example, if you use a List<Integer>, you ensure that only Integer objects can be added to the list.
//
//Code Reusability: Generics allow you to write more flexible and reusable code by
//enabling methods or classes to work with different data types without duplication. For example,
//a single class can work with both Integer and String types.
//
//Elimination of Casts: Without generics, you would often have to cast objects
//when retrieving them from a collection. With generics, the casting is handled automatically, 
//leading to cleaner and more readable code.
