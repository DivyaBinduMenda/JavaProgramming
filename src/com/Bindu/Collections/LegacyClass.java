//Legacy Classes in Java:
//Legacy classes are classes that were introduced before newer versions of Java
//(specifically, before Java 2, version 1.2) and before the 
//Java Collections Framework was introduced.
//
//These classes, such as Vector, Stack, Hashtable, 
//and Enumeration, were part of the original API but have been largely 
//superseded by modern classes like ArrayList, HashMap, and Iterator
//introduced in later versions of Java.
//
//Even though newer alternatives are preferred (because they are more 
//efficient, flexible, and offer features like generics), legacy classes 
//are still available for use in Java today, mainly for backward compatibility.
