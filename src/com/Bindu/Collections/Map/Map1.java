package com.Bindu.Collections.Map;

//1)Map contains key - value pairs
//2)The usage of map interface is to get the value without iteration
//3)in the other interfaces like list and set etc , we give the index
//and for that index it will iterate for value , but map directly 
//go to value by using key

//Major Operations
//• Creation of a map
//• Addition of elements into the map
//• Retrieval of keys from the map
//• Retrieval of values from the map
//• Deletion of elements from the map
//• Verification of keys in the map
//• Verification of values in the map
//• Updation of elements in the map
